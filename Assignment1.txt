Q1.Difference between length and length()
---> length:
     - length is a final variable applicable for arrays. With the help of the length variable, we can obtain the size of the array. 
     -The length variable is applicable to an array but not for string objects .
      
    class ArrayLength{
   public static void main(String[] args){
   int[] arr={10,20,30,40,50};
   System.out.println(arr.length);
   }
   }


Output:5


   length():
   - length() method is a final variable which is applicable for string objects. 
     -The length() method returns the number of characters present in the string. 
   - length() method is applicable for a string objects.
   - We can access the length of string element present at the particular index with the help of index value.

class LengthMethod{
public static void main(String[] args){
String [] str={"hii","hello","good","morning"};
System.out.println(str.length);
System.out.println(str[1].length());
}
}

Output:
4
5


Q2.for each loop
--->
   -  It starts with the keyword for like a normal for-loop.
    - Instead of declaring and initializing a loop counter variable, you declare a variable that is the same type of the array, followed by a colon, which is then followed by the array name.
    -Itâ€™s commonly used to iterate over an array or a Collections class
Syntax:
      for(type var:array)
      {
       statements;
       }
for each loop is not applicablewhen you want to modify the aaray.
for each only iterates forward over the array in single staeps.



Q3.Hybrid Inheritance
 ---->
  Hybrid inheritance in java ia a combination of inheritances.
  In this type of inheritance more than one kind of inheritances is obsereved.
